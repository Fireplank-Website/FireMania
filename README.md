# FireMania
A social app made with Next.js, Tailwind, NextAuth and Zustand that definitely does not look like an pre-existing app. 

## How to install and use

Clone the repository and do the following:
- Create .env.local and add at least one Oauth provider such as Google or Github.
- Paste their client id and secret in the name format of `[PROVIDER]_CLIENT_ID` and `[PROVIDER]_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Start the server locally with `npm run dev`

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
